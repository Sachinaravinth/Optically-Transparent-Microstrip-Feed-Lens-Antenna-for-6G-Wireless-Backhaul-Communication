# Optically-Transparent-Microstrip-Feed-Lens-Antenna-for-6G-Wireless-Backhaul-Communication
In this work, initially link budget analysis for deployment of wireless backhaul communication system with target data rate of 100 Gbps. Then, we have designed microstrip fed with lens antenna for operating the frequency of 300GHz.
